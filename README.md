# [Simple Quality][1]
*A short guide to quality best practices for developers.*

By Garrett Berg <vitiral@gmail.com>

# Introduction
This is a short and open-source book aimed at helping software developers
improve their software quality. It is also the primary user guide for the design
doc tool [artifact][4]. Its targeted audience are those who:
- know at least one programming language
- know revision control. If you don't know one, learn git
- want a brief guide on how to have fewer bugs, re-designs and headaches
    in all of their projects

This book can be read in full at **[gitbooks][1]**.

If you have suggestions or edits, you should be able to "start a new discussion"
by hovering over a paragraph and clicking the "+" button to the right of it.
You can also [open an issue][2]

The goal of this book is to make developing software simpler and more fun.
Think back to the time you first learned revision control. How
you were backing up files before then? Maybe you were
copying folders to some `backups` folder? Maybe you were not backing up at all?

However you did (or didn't) track your changes, think about your life before and after
revision control. Things were a lot different, and all you had to learn in order
to use revision control were:
- some simple vocabulary
- an easy to use tool
- a new way of looking at things

This is the central premise of this book: you don't need to understand
technical jargon or complex test methodologies to realize huge gains in the quality
of your software. Some simple vocabulary, new tools and new ways of looking at things
are all you need.

# [Simple Quality][1]
*A short guide to quality best practices for developers.*

By Garrett Berg <vitiral@gmail.com>

# Introduction
This is a short and open-source book aimed towards helping software developers
improve their software quality. It is targeted towards an audience that:
- knows at least one programming language
- knows revision control. If you don't know one, learn git
- wants a brief guide on how to have fewer bugs, re-designs and headaches
    in all of their projects

This book can be read in full at **[gitbooks][1]**. It is in a pre-release status,
so is NOT content-complete or edited as much as the author would like. Comments
and suggestions are always welcome.

The concepts and tools introduced in this book will make developing software
simpler and more fun. Think back to the time you first learned revision control.
Think about how you were backing up files. Maybe you were
copying folders with the date changed? Maybe you were not backing up at all?
How catastrophic could one small change be to your entire project?

However you did (or didn't) track your changes, think about your life before and after
revision control. Things were a lot different, and all you had to learn in order
to use revision control were:
- some simple vocabulary
- an easy to use tool
- a new way of looking at things

This is the central premises of this book: you don't need to understand
technical jargon or complex test methodologies to realize huge gains in the quality
of your software. Some simple vocabulary, new tools and new ways of looking at things
are all you need to get the same benefits as learning revision control.

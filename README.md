# [Software Quality For Developers][1]
By Garrett Berg

# Introduction
This is a short, free and open book aimed towards helping software developers
improve their software quality. It is targeted towards an audience that:
- knows at least one programming language
- knows revision control. If you don't know one, learn git
- wants a brief guide on how to have fewer bugs, re-designs and headaches

This book can be read in full at **[gitbooks](1)**. It is in a pre-release status,
so is NOT content-complete or edited as much as the author would like. Comments
and suggestions are always welcome.

This book can be very beneficial for you. To give you an idea of what the purpose
is, I want you to think back to the time you first learned revision control.
Think about how you were backing up files before that point. Maybe you were
copying folders with the date changed? Maybe you were not backing up at all?
How catastrophic one small change could be to your entire project?

However you did (or didn't) track your changes, think about your life before and after
revision control. Things were a lot different, and all you had to learn in order
to use revision control were:
- some simple vocabulary
- an easy to use tool
- a new way of looking at things

This is the central premises of this book: you don't need to understand
technical jargon or complex test methodologies to realize huge gains in the quality
of your software. Some simple vocabulary, new tools and new ways of looking at things
are all you need to get the same benefits as learning revision control.

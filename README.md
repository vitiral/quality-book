## Introduction
This is a short free and open book aimed towards helping software developers
improve their software quality. It is targeted towards an audience that:
- knows a programming language (python is what is used in the examples)
- knows revision control. If you don't know one, learn one first. I recommend git.
- wants a brief guide on how to have fewer bugs, re-designs and headaches when
    trying to get their code do what they want it to do.

First, a little bit about myself. I am a Software Engineer in Test
(SET) at a storage company and it is my job to think about and implement ways
to increase the quality of my company's product. This includes:
- requirements gathering
- input on detailed design documents
- risk analysis and test design
- developing automated testing and automated test frameworks
- process changes

Think back to the time you first learned revision control.
Think about how you were backing up files before that point. Maybe you were
copying folders with the date changed? Maybe you were not backing up at all,
and you would make one tiny change and all your work would go down the
drain?

However you did (or didn't) do it, think about your life before and after
revision control. Things were a lot different, weren't they? And what did you
have to learn in order to use revision control effectively? For me it was:
- some simple vocabulary
- a new shiny tool
- a new way of looking at things

This is the central premises of this book: you don't need to understand
technical jargon or complex test methodologies to realize huge gains in the quality
of your software. Some simple vocabulary, new tools and new ways of looking at things
are all you need to get the same benefits as when you learned revision control.

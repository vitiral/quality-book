Creating a quality product is no easy feat, but the quality of anything can be
improved dramatically by just learning a few tools and having a new way of
looking at things.

Minimalism is not just about having less stuff -- it is about only having the
stuff that gives you actual value.

Life has a tendency to be more complicated than it needs to be. Don't let it.
Always seek that which is truly essential and cut out that which is not.
Minimalism has more applications than how many shoes are in your closet, it can
be an approach for radical quality in everything you do.

Make sure the tools you use and develop are delivering this kind of value to
others. Increasing simplicity is what true quality really means.

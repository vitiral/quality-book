# Purpose Documentation
One of the most critical pieces of documentation that you can write is
your purpose documentation. Without purpose documentation, it is easy
to get lost in the web of your project and forget what you were trying
to accomplish in the first place. Also, purpose documentation that is
revision controlled will give you a handy reference for why you did certain
things in the past. As your project adapts and changes (and it will), so
should your purpose documentation.

Open up a text file called "README.md" in you favorite text editor.
This uses the [markdown format](1), a simple format that is worth learning,
but easy to read/copy without knowing. Here is my purpose section:

```
## Purpose:
Write a flash card quizzer from scratch and learn about quality best
practices while doing so.

The example tutorial can be found here:
    http://wiki.openhatch.org/Flash_card_challenge

```

Notice that we try to keep our purpose documentation as brief and simple
as possible. This is important for all documents, but is especially important
for high level. There is a basic rule: documentation that is not brief
and clear will not be read -- it will be skimmed. Skimmed documentation will
not get it's meaning across and will hamper your project
instead of help it. Edit and re-edit your high level docs, you will
thank yourself for it in the future.

> ### Exercise 2:
> break down the purpose documentation above into some high level
> requirements. Then give a high level specification for how you
> would approach those requirements. What programming language would you use?
> What libraries would you use? What would be your overall approach to
> each problem?

> ### Exercise 3:
> Assume your program ui would be over the command line. What kind of arguments
> and user configuration would you accept? Would you let the user use only
> one quiz file at a time, or use multiple of them? Write down your answers.

## Additional Resources

### [Stackoverflow][1]
Stackoverflow is the goto place to get your programming questions answered.
If you've never heard of it, check it out.

### rst
#### [Wiki][2]
On the rst wiki you can find the full user documentation for
rst as well as how do do things like run a web-server to
edit requirements on the web -- something that is
very important for teams that include non-developers.

#### Enterprise Plugins
There are plans in the near future to release enterprise plugins for
`rst` in tools like JIRA and Zenhub that would help to support the project.
Stay tuned.

### Agile Resources
For a company or team of committed open source developers,
agile is a highly efficient way to work together.

### Programming Languages That Help Improve Quality
I love programming languages that are expressive, fast and safe.
These languages hit all my sweet spots, and I can't recommend them
enough.

#### [rust][40]
Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents
segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. It is a programming language whose entire
purpose is to increase the quality of software written in it.

This tutorial is written using python because python is the lingua franca
of the programming world. However, python has lots of flaws for
developing quality software. Rust is everything python isn't -- fast,
safe and concurrent -- while still being incredibly fun to write.

I was a python fanatic until spending a month learning rust. It is
well worth learning.

rst is written in rust.

#### [elm][41]
The web front-end for rst is written in elm, an ultra simple functional
programming language designed to (you guessed it) write web front-ends.

Like rust (or any functional language) it is impossible
to have a runtime exception in elm. The compiler has your back,
and it is nice.

I call elm the "golang of web frontends." Compared to other functional
languages it is extremely easy to learn, has a tiny feature set and
was developed for a specific purpose.

I especially recommend it if you've never programmed in a functional
language before, as learning one can really increase your programming
chops.

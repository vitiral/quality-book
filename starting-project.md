# A Working Example

The primary teaching method that this book will employ is the "learning by doing"
approach. This is an approach that many developers are familiar with, as it is
how some of the most effective tutorials approach their subject. An "overview"
will also eventually be published, to help more advanced users.

The example project used will be the same as the one used in the [rst](1) tutorial,
which makes sense because I am the author of that tool and it was designed
specifically to address the approach to quality defined in this book. We will
install rst in a later chapter, but just know that while there is definitely
overlap between the two tutorials, they have very different purposes. rst's
tutorial is designed to teach the tool, while this is an in-depth tutorial
to unifying quality best practices.

The project we will be implementing is the [flash card challenge](2) created
by open hatch. There are several reasons this project was chosen:
- It has a clear goal with targeted users
- It is simple and yet can be extremely broad
- The guide is written in python, a language who's syntax reads largely
    like psuedo code. You should be able to follow along in any language
    that you wish to.

One of the best tutorials on C, [learn C the hard way](3), has this to
say about itself:

> LCTHW teaches real robust C coding and defensive programming tactics on real
> hardware rather than abstract machines and pedantic theory. The book
> emphasizes breaking your code on purpose, and in the process teaches a
> plethora of important topics.

There are four important aspects to the "Learn The Hard Way" method that
this tutorial will use:
1. It is designed for absolute beginners: you should know the basics of a
    programming language and revision control, and that's all you need.
2. It focuses on teaching concepts and tools which are simple and deliver
    immediate real-world value.
3. It will break down problems into component pieces and then introduce
    issues and ask you to fix them.
4. It uses exercises as the primary method that you learn. Only by actually
    doing them will you understand how the tools and processes you are reading
    are useful. So when you see exercises, like the one below, it is important
    that you do them.

> ### Exercise 1:
> Create a `README.md` file and take notes while you read the
> [flash card challenge](2) webpage. Pay close attention to:
> - what is the use case (how will this software be used)?
> - what are the inputs/outputs as presented?
>
> Then write a paragraph answering the question "how would I develop
> this application, knowing only what I know now?"

Just like revision control best practices would be meaningless without a
revision control tool like git, design best practices are meaningless without a
tool to help you track your design documents.

Okay, that isn't *quite* accurate, but it's inaccuracy is the root of why design
tools have languished so much. It is easy to think that your requirements can be
completely captured in your README, or in code documentation, or in unit tests
-- but in the end they get captured everywhere and nowhere. You end up either
repeating intention or forgetting to specify it all together.

Let's get this out of the way first: except for some of the simplest libraries,
developer documents should **not** be your only design documents! The things
your users are concerned about should almost never be the implementation details
of your project, and unless your library is so simple that all design decisions
fit in a few sentences, your code documentation won't cut it for preserving
intent or pointing out the relationships between components.

This is not to say that user (README) and developer (code) documentation are not
critical to a project's quality: they absolutely are. But they should not
replace your requirements, detailed-design or testing documents for any but the
simplest projects.

Keep in mind that it is always best practice to try and split your project into
as many small libraries as possible. Simplicity should always be the number one
goal. However, not all applications and libraries can be made so simple.

So, here are the primary tools that every developer should have under their belt
to increase the quality of their software and their productivity.

### Revision Control
This is probably the most essential tool to learn how to use, as it allows you
to code fearlessly without worrying that past efforts will be lost. We will be
using [git][1] in this tutorial to track our progress at each stage.

### Inline Documentation Renderers
[Most languages][2] can take inline documentation on your functions, classes,
etc and translate them into rendered and beautiful user docs. Some languages
support it natively, others require a separate library.

We will be writing python documentation can be natively viewed on the REPL by
calling `help(obj)` and *could* be converted using [Spinx][4].

### Unit Testing
Almost every language has a unit testing framework. Get to know yours
intimately. We will be using python's [unittest][5] package to write tests in
this tutorial and [pytest][6] to run them.

### Linters and Code Formatters
When all code is automatically formatted and linted, it is easier to read and
edit. Also, arguing over whether to use tabs or spaces is probably the least
productive thing possible. Use the default formatters and linters for your
language, it is an easy way to make your code cleaner and simpler.

We will install these in a later chapter.

### Custom Tooling, Build Systems and Scripting Languages
Some people believe that the primary responsibility of Software Engineers in
Test (my job title) is to design test cases. In my opinion, the primary job of
an SET should be to develop processes, tools and frameworks that make the entire
organization run more efficiently, more simply and with higher quality.

This section will be one of the least discussed in this book, but it can be the
most important for your future development. The problem is that it can't really
be taught except to say: always look for ways you can automate pain points and
increase simplicity. Develop tools that make it easy to interface with your
product, or hook into annoying legacy test software, or develop tests in a
simpler way. By making everyone's life easier, you will drastically increase
quality

### [artifact][7]: the design doc tool made for developers
artifact will be our bread and butter for writing and linking our design to our
source code and then hosting them as a webpage. This tool was designed
specifically to facilitate the philosophy of software quality presented in this
book. Artifact will be the topic of the next chapter.

At the end of the process, we will be able to host our design docs just like the
artifact project [design docs][8].

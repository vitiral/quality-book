"What should I test?" is one of the most challenging questions to answer when
developing software. How much testing is enough? For the average developer,
there are three kinds of testing they should be most concerned with when Unit
Testing: Functional Testing, White Box Testing and Risk Based Testing -- which
were defined in the [Vocabulary Chapter](vocabulary.md).

The easiest of these to teach (and possibly most useful) is Functional Testing,
so it is what we will be focusing on throughout this guide. However, we will be
discussing and using white box and risk-based strategies as well in an effort
to "learn by doing".

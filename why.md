# Why This Book Exists
The main reason this book exists is because of the lack of good documentation
unifying and extending quality best practices. There have been several advancements
made in how developers develop quality software, but they have been largely
piecemeal and have lacked an overview of how to fit them all together. Several
of the recent advancements include:
- new emphasis on test-driven design and developers writing their own unit
    tests
- agile processes and best practices
- better revision control tools and best practices
- well crafted linters and IDE's to help projects have easy to read code
- more emphasis on good documentation as well as programming languages supporting
	generating beautiful developer docs from inline docs

One things in common about all of these: developers tend to agree
that their lives are **better** after using these practices and tools. Programming is easier,
more fun and more fulfilling. However, all of these lack the processes,
tools and vocabulary necessary to bring them all together into an organized whole.

This book will give you the knowledge of how to unify and track all these quality
best practices as well as give you a few more tools. The tools presented in this
book will not only allow you to write better software, but they will help your
day-to-day in the same ways that good unit tests do (i.e: "wait, how did I break
*that*?" rather than "whoops, there goes my job!")

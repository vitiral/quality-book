# Why This Book Exists
There is a lack of good documentation unifying and extending quality best
practices. While there have been several advancements made in how to develop
quality software, they have largely been piecemeal and lacked the tools
fit them all together. Several of the recent advancements include:
- better revision control tools and best practices
- new emphasis on unit tests as integral to the development process
- linters and auto-formatters to help projects have easy to read code
- more emphasis on documentation, including inline developer documentation
- the agile process and associated tools

One of the things in common about all of these: developers tend to agree
that their lives are **better** after using them. Programming is easier,
more fun and more fulfilling. However, all of these lack the processes,
tools and vocabulary necessary to bring them together into an organized whole.

This book will give you the knowledge of how to unify and track all these quality
best practices. The tools presented in this book will not only allow you to
write better software, but will help your day-to-day workflow in the same ways
that good unit tests do: "wait, how did I break *that*?" rather than "whoops,
there goes my job!"

# Why are we here?
The main reason this book exists is because of the lack of good documentation
about quality best practices. There have been several advancements made in
how developers develop quality software, but they have been largely piecemeal
and have lacked an overview of how to fit them all together. Several of the
recent advancements include:
- better revision control tools and best practices
- well crafted linters and IDE's to help projects have easy to read code
- new emphasis on test driven design, especially the philosophy of test
    driven design.
- more emphasis on good documentation as well as programming languages supporting
    documentation inline with code.

One thing is common about all of these: developers tend to agree
that their lives are **better** after using these practices and tools. Programming is easier,
more fun and more fulfilling. However, all of these lack the processes,
tools and vocabulary necessary to bring them all together into an organized whole.
This book will give you the knowledge of how to unify and track all these quality
best practices as well as give you a few more tools. The tools presented in this
book will not only allow you to write better software, but they will help your
day-to-day in the same ways that good unit tests do.

The primary teaching method that this book will employ is the "learning by doing"
approach. This is an approach that many developers are familiar with, as it is
how some of the most effective tutorials approach the subject. An "overview" of
the subject will also eventually be published, to help more advanced users.

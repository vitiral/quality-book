# Why This Book Exists
There is a lack of good documentation unifying and extending quality best
practices. There have been several advancements made in how to develop
quality software, but they have been largely piecemeal and have lacked an
overview of how to fit them all together. Several of the recent advancements
include:
- new emphasis on unit tests as integral to the development process
- agile processes and best practices
- better revision control tools and best practices
- well crafted linters and formatters to help projects have easy to read code
- more emphasis on documentation and programming languages which support
    inline documentation for generating developer docs

One of the things in common about all of these: developers tend to agree
that their lives are **better** after using these practices and tools. Programming is easier,
more fun and more fulfilling. However, all of these lack the processes,
tools and vocabulary necessary to bring them all together into an organized whole.

This book will give you the knowledge of how to unify and track all these quality
best practices as well as give you a few more tools. The tools presented in this
book will not only allow you to write better software, but they will help your
day-to-day in the same ways that good unit tests do: "wait, how did I break
*that*?" rather than "whoops, there goes my job!"
